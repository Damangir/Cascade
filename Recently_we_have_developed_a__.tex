Recently, we have developed a fully automatic WMC (age-related WMC, MS lesion) segmentation algorithm \cite{CascadeOrig} that employed multispectral MRI information and a supervised machine learning method. It depended on manual delineation of the WMC, produced sharp segmentation boundaries without taking partial volumes into account and without handling dirty white matter.
