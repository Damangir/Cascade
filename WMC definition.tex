\subsection{WMC definition} \label{definition}
The common definition of WMC is based on their visual properties on specific sequences (hyper- or hypo-intensities) which has been proved not to be reproducible enough for large multi-center studies. 
\par
We incorporated the common definition of WMC in a new statistical definition which can be robustly measured. Here we  define \textbf{WMC as areas where their local image histogram are significantly different from the expected normal local histogram on one-tail test}.
\par
It is important to recognize that our statistical definition differs from learning methods and outlier detection method, where statistical features of manual delineated WMC is captured in a supervised or unsupervised way.
On the other hand we define WMC and show segmentation based on it corresponds to those based on current accepted definition.
\par
The proposed definition depends on calculating expected normal local histogram. In the present paper expected local histograms of normal brain are calculated for each voxel as the average of local histogram of evidently normal voxels in the same subject. Evidently normal voxels are calculated in two thresholding steps which is described in section \ref{evident}.
