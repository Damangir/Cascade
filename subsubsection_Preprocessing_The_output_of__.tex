\subsubsection{Preprocessing}
The output of preprocessing is co-registered and inhomogeneity corrected images and brain tissues segmentation. The following enumerates preprocessing steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Intra-subject registration (reference image is userâ€™s choice) using rigid 3D transformation with mutual information
\item Standard space to subject registration using affine 3D transformation between the native and MNI space using mutual information
\item Skull stripping: MNI brain mask is registered to native space. The registered brain mask is eroded with a 5mm spherical structuring element and the eroded mask is extended using a region-growing algorithm.
\item Inhomogeneity correction performed on all registered input images using N3 algorithm \cite{N3}
\item Brain tissue segmentation using Bayesian inference
\begin{itemize}
    \item Prior probability distribution is estimated by registering the average MNI tissue maps to the native space. Tissue model is the marginal probability distribution of intensities of the 3 tissue types, which is calculated by using the algorithm described in \cite{EM_Empirical}. Initial brain tissue segmentation is performed using the tissue model and prior probabilities
    \item Updating the initial tissue segmentation using a new tissue probability model at each voxel which is the relative frequency of each tissue type in adjacent voxels in a sphere of radius 1mm
    \item Removing potential WMC that was classified as GM: GM voxels that are bright on T2 images (>85\% of GM) or FLAIR image (>90\% of GM) are labeled as suspect voxels. Suspected voxels surrounded by mostly WM will be labeled as WM and voxels surrounded by mostly GM will be labeled back to GM
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
