\subsubsection{Preprocessing}
The output of preprocessing is co-registered and inhomogeneity corrected images and brain tissues segmentation. The following enumerates preprocessing steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Intra-subject registration (reference image is userâ€™s choice) using rigid 3D transformation with mutual information
\item Standard space to subject registration using affine 3D transformation between the native and MNI space using mutual information
\item Skull stripping: MNI brain mask is registered to native space. The registered brain mask is eroded with a 5mm spherical structuring element and the eroded mask is extended using a region-growing algorithm.
\item Inhomogeneity correction performed on all registered input images using N3 algorithm \cite{N3}
\item Brain tissue segmentation using Bayesian inference
\end{enumerate}
