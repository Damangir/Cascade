\subsubsection{WMC definition}
The common definition of WMC is based on their visual properties on specific sequences (hyper- or hypo-intensities). We define WMC as areas where the local image histogram is significantly different from the expected local histogram on one-tail test against the null hypothesis that every voxel is non-WMC. The common definition of WMC is incorporated in our definition as a concrete statistical one which can be robustly measured.
