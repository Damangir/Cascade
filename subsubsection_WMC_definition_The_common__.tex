\subsubsection{WMC definition}
The common definition of WMC is based on their visual properties on specific sequences (hyper- or hypo-intensities) which has been proved to not to be reproducible enough for large multi-center studies. 
\par
We incorporated the common definition of WMC in a definition as a concrete statistical one which can be robustly measured. Here we  define WMC as areas where their local image histogram are significantly different from the expected normal local histogram on one-tail test.
\par
It is important to recognize that our statistical definition differs from learning methods and outlier detection method, where statistical features of manual delineated WMC is captured in either supervised or unsupervised way.
On the other hand we define WMC and show segmentation based on it corresponds to those based on current accepted definition.
