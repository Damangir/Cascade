The method was tested given any combinations of available sequences (T1-weighted, T2-weighted, FLAIR and PD) and validated against manual delineation, which is considered as the golden standard. The results of different combinations are also cross-validated against one another to assess the expected robustness of the method in order to assure usability for analyzing multi-center datasets.
