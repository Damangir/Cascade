The aim of this study is to create a robust method having as many characteristics of an ideal algorithm as possible. The method is based on a proposed strict statistical definition of WMC in order to achieve the desirable features. The statistical definition is inherently reproducible and free from manual training; and is applicable to several widely used MRI sequences (T1-weighted, T2-weighted, FLAIR and PD).
